Made with ðŸ’š by Prakrit Pathak

I made this Project under the Supervision of mentors allotted to us by Microsoft.

Prerequisites:
You'll  need an in-depth understanding of Flutter and Agora SDK for this project.


To run this application, you'll need an app ID , for which you will need to make a developer account on Agora.io.
Make a new project, and copy the app ID of the project in the settings.dart file.
