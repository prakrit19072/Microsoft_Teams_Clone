A clone of the popular Microsoft Teams App made using Flutter and Agora SDK.
Made with ðŸ’š by Prakrit Pathak

I made this Project under Microsoft's Flagship student engagement program-Microsoft Engage.

Prerequisites:
You'll  need an in-depth understanding of Flutter and Agora SDK for this project.


To run this application, you'll need an app ID , for which you will need to make a developer account on Agora.io.
Make a new project, and copy the app ID of the project in the settings.dart file.
